									due to market, policy and institutional failures, agrifood systems are fragile and unsustainable, contributing to climate change and natural resource degradation while failing to provide healthy diets to all.
									These factors have helped feed a population that has tripled and become more urbanized. Consequently, the share of the population employed in agriculture has declined, while jobs have been created in upstream and downstream value chains and other sectors.
									This edition of The State of Food and Agriculture aims to initiate a process that aspires to analyse the complexity and interdependencies of agrifood systems and how they affect the environment, society, health and the economy through true cost accounting (TCA)
									Produced capital contributes research and development, among other things, and agrifood systems generate income, profits, rent and taxes in return. While these flows seem intuitive, little has been done to measure them and manage their impacts, with the exception of produced capital.
									
									Governments generate price incentives or disincentives through trade and market interventions. These generally consist of border measures (such as import tariffs or quotas, export bans or subsidies) and/or market price regulations (such as domestic price fixation policies). These interventions create a gap between the domestic and international prices of targeted products and/or help to curb demand for targeted foods.
									A novel true cost accounting analysis of 154 countries provides preliminary estimates of the “quantified hidden costs” of agrifood systems. Referring to them as “quantified” acknowledges the data gaps in many countries that prevent the estimation of all hidden costs, such as those associated with pesticide exposure and land degradation.

									As mentioned in Chapter 1, underpinning the unsustainability of agrifood systems are costs that are hidden behind price tags and go unaccounted for by agrifood systems actors. These hidden costs – including water pollution, biodiversity loss and NCDs – are driven by negative externalities and other market failures (or their spillovers), as well as by policy and institutional failures. The key to transitioning agrifood systems towards sustainability is to measure and value these hidden costs across the environmental, social and health dimensions.

									It is important to distinguish pathways from impacts. A pathway captures the drivers of an impact and can therefore provide entry points for action to address said impact. To illustrate, a hidden cost may be generated through an environmental pathway but its negative consequences manifest beyond the environment. Water pollution is a case in point: it negatively impacts the environment through the loss of ecosystem services, but also health through burden of disease from intake of polluted water. These two negative impacts, however, are considered environmental hidden costs because both are generated through an environmental pathway, and therefore the entry point for addressing them remains within the environmental domain.
									
									For this reason, unhealthy dietary patterns and undernourishment are considered health and social hidden costs, respectively, despite both relating to diet and food consumption. 
									
									Agrifood systems are complex, making it difficult to measure their impact comprehensively. As a result, targeted assessments that focus on key sectors and challenges are necessary.
									
									Laws and regulations can be used by governments to influence agricultural production and food supply chains, setting standards and targets that affect both producers and intermediaries. Laws and regulations are mostly designed to safeguard natural resources and human health from damage that could result from externalities associated with, for example, production and processing. Commonly cited examples in this regard are regulations on natural resource use, input and fertilizer applications, safe food handling, and food labelling and marketing. An example is the European Union regulation on deforestation-free products, which bars companies from putting products on the EU market unless they are deforestation-free and legally produced and makes it illegal to export such products from the bloc.8 Another example is the ten-year fishing ban on the waters of the Yangtze River, recently introduced by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs with a view to conserving living aquatic resources.9 In Latin America and the Caribbean, various countries have enacted laws or regulations on front-of-pack nutrition labelling.10 For instance, Ecuador has a traffic light system, while the Plurinational State of Bolivia has approved the same system, but has yet to implement it. Such systems can effectively reduce the intention to buy products with excessive calories, sugars, sodium and saturated fats, help consumers make healthier choices, and contribute to the reformulation of food products. In Chile, for example, nutritional warnings with black octagons reduced purchases of sugar-sweetened cereal and beverages by 25 percent and 9 percent, respectively.10

									In Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, a scenario analysis has shown that redirecting fiscal subsidies to producers to support healthy diets and shifting tax subsidies from producers to consumers could increase the affordability of healthy diets.2 However, the analysis recognizes that more research is needed on the potential trade-offs that may exist in terms of economic, environmental and consumption-related behavioural impacts.10 Looking at national examples of agricultural support reform and repurposing can further illustrate its potential benefits. Viet Nam, for instance, has taken important steps to shift agricultural support to less distorting forms of assistance and to promote credit schemes that pay more attention to sustainability and resilience.13, 14 Over the last decade, the country has lowered border protection and price supports and promoted subsidies that are not tied to the production of a specific crop and include greater sensitivity to agrifood systems sustainability. Similarly, in the Republic of Korea, price support policies have been de-emphasized in favour of income support and subsidies with a green farm focus.13 At the same time, in low-income countries, which are mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa and where the affordability of food is a key concern, governments adopt policies that tend to suppress producer prices. Public resources to provide fiscal subsidies are also limited, so cannot compensate for the price disincentives generated by trade and market policies. Despite these challenges, recent evidence indicates that, following recent reforms, some input subsidy programmes have been downsized, increasing the fiscal space to allocate more funds to general services and public goods, which generate more sustainable and broad-based impacts (see Box 1).15	

									In conclusion to this section, the question of creating synergies between the different levers and the way they are implemented remains a priority for achieving the desired outcomes. As stated in The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022, repurposing public support to the food and agriculture sector will not be enough. Policymakers need to avoid potential trade-offs that may emerge. For example, farmers may not be in a position to scale up the production of nutritious and sustainable foods due to resource constraints that prevent them from accessing technologies that enhance environmental sustainability. Moreover, repurposing, if not well-designed, can lead to unintended consequences on the most vulnerable, particularly small-scale producers, women and children.2 A TCA approach provides a comprehensive framework for thinking through these and other trade-offs and linking agrifood systems to other – environmental, health, transportation and energy – systems. Then, targeted TCA assessments can generate insights into how to overcome them by unveiling the outcomes of policies, not only in terms of efficiency, but also equity, nutrition, health and environmental quality.
